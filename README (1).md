# Diabetes Prediction System Using KNN

This project is a simple machine learning model to predict diabetes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python.

## Motivation

Diabetes is a chronic health condition affecting millions globally. In Nigeria, the rate has increased from 0.7% to 20%. Many cases remain undiagnosed due to poverty and poor healthcare access. This project aims to provide a foundational model for early diabetes detection.

## Files

- `diabetes_data.csv` – Sample dataset for training/testing the model.
- `diabetes_knn_predictor.py` – Python script that loads the data, trains a KNN model, and prints performance metrics.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python and required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python diabetes_knn_predictor.py
   ```
